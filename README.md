# LNOBT Ticket App 

Disclaimer:

This app is a university homework project and **not affiliated with LNOBT** (Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre).  
Some textual content (e.g. show titles, descriptions) and visual elements (e.g. images or icons) were used from the official LNOBT website **strictly for educational purposes only**.

The app was created as a learning exercise to explore mobile app development using Jetpack Compose, Firebase, and MVVM architecture. It is **not intended for commercial use** or public distribution.

This is my **first try making an Android app from scratch**.

The app lets users:
- See some of the LNOBT shows
- Pick dates and seat areas
- Reserve tickets (simulated)

Built with:
- Firebase Firestore
- Jetpack Compose

The app is still in progress.
